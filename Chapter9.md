* Background
* Contiguous Memory Allocation
* Paging


## Paging
* a memory-management scheme that permits a process's physical address space to be non-contiguous
* avoids external fragmentation and the associated need for compaction

### Basic Method
* breading physical memory into fixed-sized blocks - **frames**
* breaking logical memory into blocks of the same size - **pages**
* Every address generated by the CPU is divided into 2 parts:
	- page number (p)
	- page offset (d)
* Page number
	- used as an index into a per-process page table
* Page table
	- contains the base address of each frame in physical memory
* Offset
	- the location in the frame being referenced
* physical memory address
	- the base address of the frame combined with the page offset
* MMU translates a logical address generated by the CPU to a physical address by following steps:
	1. Extract the page number *p* and use it as an index into the page table
	2. Extract the corresponding frame number *f* from the page table
	3. Replace the page number *p* in the logical address with the frame number *f*

### Exercises
1. Name two differences between logical and physical address <br />
2. Why are page sizes always powers of 2? <br />
	(p361) The selection of a power of 2 as a page size makes the translation of a logical address into a page number and page offset particularly easy.
