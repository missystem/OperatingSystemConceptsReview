* Background
* Contiguous Memory Allocation
* Paging


## Paging
* a memory-management scheme that permits a process's physical address space to be non-contiguous
* avoids external fragmentation and the associated need for compaction

### Basic Method
* breading physical memory into fixed-sized blocks - **frames**
* breaking logical memory into blocks of the same size - **pages**
* Every address generated by the CPU is divided into 2 parts:
	- page number (p)
	- page offset (d)
* Page number
	- used as an index into a per-process page table
* Page table
	- contains the base address of each frame in physical memory
* Offset
	- the location in the fram being referenced 
* physical memory address
	- the base address of the frame combined with the page offset
