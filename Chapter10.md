## memory management:
* Goal:
  - to keep many processes in memory simultaneously to allow multiprogramming.
* Technique:
  - Virtual memory
    - allows the execution of processes that are not completely in memory
* major advantage of virtual memory:
  - programs can be larger than physical memory
* Virtual memory abstracts main memory into extremely large, uniform array of storage, separating logical memory as viewed by the programmer from physical memory
