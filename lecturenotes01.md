## [Lecture 01: Introduction to Operating Systems (Chapter 1)](https://github.com/missystem/cis415review/blob/master/lecture-1-introduction.pdf)

### What is Operating System
- a program that acts as an intermediary between a user of a computer and the computer hardware

### What does an OS do?
* Acts as a Resource manager
* Process
	- hides programs from one another
* Traffic cop
	- resource management
	- decide which program to run and when
* Memory management
	- protection from other programs' mistakes
* Security
	- protection from other programs' malice
* System call interface
	- abstract, simplified interface to services
	- like a function library, but communicates with the OS
* Device management
* Communication
	- between processes
	- to devices & networks

 
### OS system goals
* Execute user programs
* Make solving user problems easier
* Make the computer system covenient to use
* Use the computer hardware in an efficient manner

### Computer System Structure
* Hardware
	- provides basic computing resources
	- CPU, memory, I/O devices
* Operating system
	- controls and coordinates use of hardware among various applications and users
* Application programs
	- use system resources to solve computing problems
	- word processors, compilers, web browsers, database systems, video games, ...
* Users
	- People, machines, other computers

### Basic Computer System Organization
* Computer-system operation
	- One or more CPUs, device ontrollers connect through common bus providing access to shared memory
	- Concurrent execution of CPUs and devices competing for memory cycles

### Computer System Architecture
* Traditionally, most systems use a single general-purpose processor 
	- Most systems have special-purpose processors as well
* Modern computers use multiprocessor systems now
	- Advantages:
		- Increased throughput
		- Economy of scale
		- Increased reliability – graceful degradation or fault tolerance
	- Types:
		- Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) - each processor performs all tasks
		- asymmetric multiprocessing – each processor has a specific task

	- Can run parallel applications

### Computer System Operation
* I/O devices & the CPU can execute concurrently
* Each device controller 
	- is in charge of a device type
	- has a local buffer
* CPU moves data between main memory & local buffers associated with I/O devices
* I/O is from the device -> local buffer of controller
* Device controller informs CPU that it has finished its operation by causing an **interrupt**

### What Operating Systems Do?
* User view:
	- ease of use, convenience, performance
	- dedicated resources
* Server (System) view:
	- shared resources
	- keep all users happy

### Operating System Definition
* Resource allocation and control
* as Resource allocator
	- manages all resources (CPU time, memory space, storage space, I/O devices, etc)
	- Figure possibly conflicting requests for resources
		- OS decides how to allocate them to specific programs and users so that it can operate the computer system efficiently and fairly.

* as Control program
	- manages the execution of user programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer
* Different view on scope:
	- it includes everything a vendor ships when you order “the operating system”
	- the OS is the one program running at all times on the computer — usually called the kernel
		- 2 other types of programs: 
			- system programs, which are associated with the operating system but are not necessarily part of the kernel
			- application programs, which include all programs not associated with the operation of the system.

### Page Fault Handling
* is caused when access to a virtual memory location is not found in physical memory
* What happens?
	- Interrupt is generated by the hardware
	- Handler in OS determines how to obtain memory
	- If page is still on disk, then handler (page: fixed sized block of data)
		- allocates physical page
		- makes I/O request to disk via file system and driver
	- Driver copies page from disk into new physical page
	- OS restarts the process at the interrupted instruction
* Multiple processes -> more complex
* OS has to make trade-offs

### Learning about OS
* OS has many protocols like page fault handling
* OS designers add layers of abstraction to simplify programming (e.g., virtual memory)
* The design of protocols using these concepts involves trade-offs (e.g., disk performance)

### Common Functions of Interrupts
* Interrupt transfers control to the interrupt service routine, generally through an interrupt vectors
* The operating system preserves the state of the CPU by storing registers and the program counter
* Determines which type of interrupt has occurred: 
	- Polling
	- Vectored interrupt system
* Interrupt architecture must save the address of the
interrupted instruction
* A trap (or an exception) is a software-generated interrupt, caused 
	- by an error (division by zero or invalid memory access)
	- by a specific request from a user program, that an operating-system service be performed by executing a special operation called a system call
* An operating system is interrupt driven

### I/O Structure
After I/O starts, control returns to user program ...
* Only upon I/O completion
	- wait instruction idles the CPU until the next interrupt 
	- wait loop (contention for memory access)
	- at most one I/O request is outstanding at a time
* Without waiting for I/O completion
	- system call – request to the OS to allow user to wait for I/O completion
	- device-status table contains entry for each I/O device indicating its type, address, and state
	- OS indexes into I/O device table to determine device status and to modify table entry to include interrupt

### Interrupt Timeline
<img src="https://github.com/missystem/cis415review/blob/master/ch1_interrupt_timeline.png">

### I/O Sturcture - 2 Methods
<img src="https://github.com/missystem/cis415review/blob/master/ch1_two_IO_methods.png">
* Synchronous
	- After I/O starts, control returns to user program only upon I/O completion
	- A wait instruction idles the CPU until next interrupt
	- Or the CPU runs a wait loop (problems?)
	- No simultaneous I/O processing (only 1 request)
* Asynchronous
	- After I/O starts, control returns to user program without waiting for I/O completion
	- User program then waits for I/O complete
	- I/O interrupts upon completion

### Device Status Table
<img src="https://github.com/missystem/cis415review/blob/master/ch1_device_status_table.png">
* When a kernel supports asynchronous I/O, it must be able to keep track of many I/O requests at the same time. For this purpose, the operating system might attach the wait queue to a device-status table. The kernel manages this table, which contains an entry for each I/O device. Each table entry indicates the device’s type, address, and state (not functioning, idle, or busy). If the device is busy with a request, the type of request and other parameters will be stored in the table entry for that device.

### Timer Interrupts for Kernel Control
* Prevent infinite loop / process hogging resources
	- Timer is set to interrupt the computer after some time period
	- Keep a counter that is decremented by the physical clock
	- Operating system set the counter (privileged instruction)
	- When counter reaches zero, generate an interrupt
	- Set up before scheduling process to regain control or terminate program that exceeds allotted time

### Process Management
* A **process** is a program in execution
	- A **program** is a passive entity
	- A process is an active entity (unit of work in the system)
* Process needs resources to accomplish its task
	- CPU, memory, I/O, files
	- Initialization data
* Process termination requires reclaim of any reusable resources
* **Single-threaded process** has one program counter specifying location of next instruction to execute
	- Process executes instructions sequentially
	- One at a time, until completion
* **Multi-threaded process** has one program counter per thread
* Typically system has many processes, some user, some operating system running concurrently on one or more CPUs
	- Concurrency by multiplexing the CPUs among the processes / threads

### Process Management Activities
* Creating & deleting both user and system processes
* Suspending & resuming processes
* Providing mechanisms for 
	- process synchronization
	- process communication
	- deadlock handling

### Scheduling
* Determine which task to perform given:
	- Multiple user processes
	- Multiple hardware components
* Provide effective performance
	- Responsive to users, CPU utilization
* Provide fairness
	- Avoid starvation for low priority processes

### Memory Management
* To execute a program, all (or part) of the instructions must be in memory
* All (or part) of the data that is needed by the program must be in memory
* Memory management determines what is in memory and when
	- Optimizing both the CPU utilization and the computer's responding speed users
* Memory management activities
	- keeping track of which parts of memory are currently being used and by whom
	- deciding which processes (or parts thereof) and data to move into and out of memory
	- allocating and deallocating memory space as needed

### Storage Hierarchy
<img src="https://github.com/missystem/cis415review/blob/master/figure1.6.png">

### Storage Management
* OS provides uniform, logical view of information storage
	- Abstracts physical properties to logical storage unit - file
	- Each medium is controlled by device
		- varying properties include: access speed, capacity, data-transfer rate, access method (sequential or random)
* File-System management
	- Files usually organized into directories
	- Access control on most systems determines who can access what
	- OS activities include
		- creating and deleting files and directories
		- primitives to manipulate files and directories
		- mapping files onto secondary storage
		- backup files onto stable (non-volatile) storage media

### Protection and Security
* Protection
	- any mechanism for controlling access of processes or users to resources defined by the OS
* Security
	- defense of the system against internal and external attacks
* Systems generally first distinguish among users, ways to determine who can do what:
	- User identities (user IDs, security IDs) 
		- include name and associated number, one per user
	- User ID
		- associated with all files, processes of that user to determine access control
	- Group identifier (group ID)
		- allows set of users to be defined and controls managed, then also associated with each process, file
	- Privilege escalation 
		- allows user to change to effective ID with more rights

### OS Structures
* Multiprogramming (batch system)
	- Single user cannot keep CPU and I/O devices busy at all times
	- Multiprogramming organizes jobs (code & data) so CPU always has one to execute
	- A subset of total jobs in system is kept in memory
	- One job selected and run via job scheduling
	- When it has to wait (e.g., I/O), OS switches to another job
* Multitasking (timesharing)
	- Logical extension of multiprogramming
	- The CPU executes multiple processes by switching among them frequently
	- Response time should be < 1s
	- Each user has ≥ 1 program executing in memory
	- If several jobs ready to run at the same time, system chooses which process will run next (CPU scheduling)
	- Virtual memory allows the execution of a processes that is not completely in memory (ensure reasonable response time)

### Computing Environments – Traditional
* Stand-alone general purpose machines
* But blurred as most systems interconnect with others (i.e., the Internet)
* Portals provide web access to internal systems
* Network computers (thin clients) are like Web terminals
* Mobile computers (Smart phones) interconnect via wireless networks
* Networking becoming ubiquitous 
	- even home systems use firewalls to protect home computers from Internet attacks

### Computing Environments – Distributed
* Collection of separate, possibly heterogeneous, systems networked together
	- network is a communications path, TCP/IP most common
		- Local Area Network (LAN)
		- Wide Area Network (WAN)
		- Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
		- Personal Area Network (PAN)
* Network OS provides features between systems across network
	- communication scheme allows systems to exchange messages
	- illusion of a single system

### Computing Environments – Client-Server
* Dumb terminals supplanted by smart PCs
* Many systems now servers, responding to requests generated by clients
	- compute-server system
		- provides an interface to client to request services (i.e., database)
	- file-server system
		- provides interface for clients to store and retrieve files
<img src="https://github.com/missystem/cis415review/blob/master/figure1.22.png">

### Computing Environments – Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
* Another model of distributed system
* Does not distinguish clients & servers
	- all nodes are considered peers
	- each node may act as client, server or both
	- node must join P2P network
		- registers its service with central lookup service on network, or
		- broadcast request for service and respond to requests for service via discovery protocol
	- Examples: Napster and Gnutella, Voice over IP (VoIP) (e.g., Skype)

### Computing Environments – Mobile
* Handheld smartphones, tablets, ...
* What is the functional difference between them and a "traditional" laptop?
	- Extra feature 
	- more OS features (GPS, gyroscope)
	- Allows new types of apps like augmented reality
	- Use IEEE 802.11 wireless, or cellular data networks for connectivity
	- Leaders: Apple IOS, Google Android
	- "Internet of Things" (IoT)

### Computing Environments – Virtualization
* Allows OSes to run applications within other OSes
* Emulation used when source CPU type different from target type (i.e., PowerPC to Intel x86)
	- Generally slowest method
	- When computer language not compiled to native code - Interpretation
* Virtalization
	- OS natively compiled for CPU, running guest OSes also natively compiled
		- Consider VMware running WinXP guests, each running applications, all on native WinXP host OS
		- VMM (Virtual Machine Manager) provides virtualization services
* Use cases involve laptops and desktops running multiple OSes for exploration or compatibility
	- Apple laptop running Mac OS X host, Windows as a guest
	- Developing apps for multiple OSes without having multiple systems
	- QA testing applications without having multiple systems
	- Executing and managing computing environments within data centers
* VMM can run natively, in which case they are also the host
	- Then there is no general purpose host (VMware ESX and Citrix XenServer)

### Computing Environments – Cloud Computing
* Delivers computing, storage, even applications as a service across a network
	- IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
* Logical extension of virtualization because it uses virtualization as the base for it functionality
* Cloud computing environments composed of traditional OSes, plus VMMs, plus cloud management tools
	- Internet connectivity requires security like firewalls
	- Load balancers spread traffic across multiple applications
<img src="https://github.com/missystem/cis415review/blob/master/figure1.24.png">

### Open Source Operating Systems
* Operating systems made available in source-code format rather than just binary closed-source
* Counter to the copy protection and Digital Rights Management (DRM) movement
* Started by Free Software Foundation (FSF), which has “copyleft” GNU Public License (GPL)
* Examples include GNU/Linux and BSD UNIX (including core of Mac OS X), and many more
* Can use VMM like VMware Player (Free on Windows), VirtualBox (open source and free)
	- Use to run guest operating systems for exploration
